    <h2> Child Care Centers in Morris County, New Jersey</h2></h2>
    <h3> By Karina Babcock</h3>
<p> The Goddard School has five locations in Morris County, the most of any child care center. Denville employee Lily Kahn, who has been working full-time in the childcare industry since 2020, weighs in.</p>

        <p>New Jersey’s public schools and child care centers are favorably ranked by data-based sources like the U.S. News & World Report, and trusted parenting resources such as Care.com.

        <p></p>Lily Kahn of Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, took on the leadership role of a Girl Scout Counselor when she was 16 years old. Coupled with her role as an older sister and cousin, those positive experiences inspired her to continue working with children. Now 22, Kahn describes the joy she feels when each day begins.
            
        <p></p>“My favorite part of my job is having the children be happy when you enter the room,” Kahn said.
            
        <p></p> The Goddard School is the child care facility company with the most locations in New Jersey, amounting to five. The Jefferson Child Care & Education Center, Roxbury Day Care Center, Inc. Before & After School Program, and The Learning Experience each have four locations, and there are only six other companies with more than one business in Morris County.
            
        <p></p>The Denville location of the Goddard School where Kahn works currently has 152 children, ranging in age from infants to preschoolers. She primarily works with 14-18 month olds, but she occasionally watches almost two year-olds if need be. In Kahn’s classroom, there are approximately four children to every one teacher.
            
        <p></p>Their daily routine is stimulating and fun, starting with changing diapers if needed. The children are given parent-packed snacks and playtime - outside if the weather permits. After getting some energy out, it’s time for lunch and a nap. The sensory play that follows is more structured, with educational toys and games. Arts and crafts and circle time finishes the day, which is the area where Kahn specializes in leading.
            
        <p></p>Parenting and teaching author Barbara Colorose once said that “If kids come to us from strong, healthy, functioning families, it makes our job easier. If they do not come to us from strong, healthy, functioning families, it makes our job more important.” Kahn sees the value in showing up for the children as if they were her own, since child care facilities are locations of important milestones.
            
        <p></p>Unfortunately, many child care providers believe their services are underpaid and undervalued by society. The Center for the Study of Child Care Employment reported that in 2019, median hourly wages for child care workers ranged from $8.94 in Mississippi to $15.36 in the District of Columbia, but in 28 states, which is more than half the country, the median wage for child care workers was less than $11 per hour.
            
        <p></p>Kahn was not asked to share her wages, but the current average hourly pay for child care workers in New Jersey is $15, according to an April 2024 announcement from ZipRecruiter.

        <p>Workers at child care centers are not underpaid because few families are in need of them. Morris County has a population of 511,000, and there are 270 facilities throughout the county. Areas such as Millington, Mount Arlington, and Mount Olive only have one facility, whereas Parsippany, Morristown, and Chatham have 22, 20, and 16, respectively. Denville, Kahn’s place of employment, follows right behind Chatham with 13 facilities and is tied with Rockaway. Kahn’s hometown of Mountain Lakes has 6 locations.

        <p></p>The Goddard School is also located in Flanders, Florham Park, Parsippany, Randolph, and Towaco. Kahn’s Denville location has the second-highest number of attendees, with the Towaco location reporting 165 children in comparison to Denville’s 152. Even the smallest Goddard School in Flanders is still popular with 120 daily attendees.
            
        <p></p>Child care workers are essential parts of kids’ developments whose parents drop them off for the day, no matter who they are, where they come from, or why they attend daycare.
            
        <p></p>President Joe Biden said it himself, that “Child care workers represent the best of who we are as Americans. You’re the heroes to so many individuals. Care workers and caregivers are critical to our families and to the entire economy.”
